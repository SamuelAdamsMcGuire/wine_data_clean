<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal was to parse over 320k wine review pages into a clean pandas dataframe. The pages were downloaded locally from a google bucket using the following command:
```
gsutil -m cp -r gs://name-of-bucket
```

Once the data was stored locally I developed a module to parse the pages for the data found relevant for use in a ML prediction model that will make wine recommendation base on the users taste.  

The following features were scraped:

- Wine name
- Winery name
- Category: type of wine, i.e. red, white, sparkling
- Designation
- Varietal: type of grape
- Appellation: the region the wine comes from
- Alcohol content
- Price
- Rating
- Reviewer name
- Review

Here is a link to the complete `csv` file since it was too large to push to github:

The next step is to preform some NLP preprocessing and train a model. The final goal is to deploy the model as a web application.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To properly get started see [samssimplescraper](https://github.com/SamuelAdamsMcGuire/simplescraper) and [wine data collection](https://github.com/SamuelAdamsMcGuire/wine_data_collection) for instructions on how to scrape the entire dataset. 

Otherwise clone this repository and us the example `html` files in this repo to experiment with. 

### Prerequisites

- See requirements for need python libraries

### Installation

Clone repository
  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:SamuelAdamsMcGuire/wine_data_clean.git
  ```

Install requirements_
```shell

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Code can be used as is for learning purposes. Or it can be adapted to user's goal. Follow the **Roadmap** and feel free to get in touch with any and all questions or comments. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

1. Clone this repository.

2. Adjust script for the one example file (feel free to ask for my assistance). Or use on a larger dataset that is scraped using the aforementioned tools.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/SamuelAdamsMcGuire/wine_data_clean/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
